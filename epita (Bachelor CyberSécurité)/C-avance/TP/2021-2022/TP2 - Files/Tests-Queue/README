In order to test your library:
1) copy "libmyqueue.a" in this folder
2) copy your "queue_array.h", "queue_linked_list.h", "queue_static.h" here
3) launch "make" one time
4) you can now launch the tests with the .exe!

./main_array_1_NULL.exe
./main_array_2_empty.exe
./main_array_3_regular.exe
./main_array_4_hard.exe

Don't forget to check for leaks and errors with valgrind
For debugging binaries, just launch the configure with "DEBUG" as a parameter

valgrind ./main_array_3_regular.exe

ll: linked list version
array: array version
static: static array version

Don't forget: be sure to validate a step before going further
