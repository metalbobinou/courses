# How to use the test suite

1) copy libmylpf.a in this directory
2) launch "configure" with or without "DEBUG" parameter
3) launch "check.sh" or call "make" ("make" is better)
3bis) "make list" or "make stack" or "make queue" will compile only one of the
      test suite on one of the structure
3ter) "make full" will compile the full tests, and "make" or "check.sh" will
      compile every possible combination of tests
4) launch "test" or "test-list" or "test-stack" or "test-queue" for testing
   every structure or one of the structure
